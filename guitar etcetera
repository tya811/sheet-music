so you can probably do this on youtube:
run youtube and soundcloud etcetera through  i guess what would amount to digital oscilloscopes
and then automatically tab out the songs and write sheet music automatically. 

and then you can reverse the process and send the guitar, bass and drum tabs online through a benchmark testing software that just plays those
notes as they are tabbed in time with the song and edit the tab to make it correct and then al the guitar tabs in the world will be correct
and links should be displayed with tutorials in youtube. 

make it easy to learn solos and learn how to play the guitar
